Sr.No,Question From Fractal,Answer From Levi's
1,What is the total number of source systems that would be part of the scope,"Data available on GCP and AWS.  
Some localized master data attributes need to be gathered manually."
2,Initialy how many countries data we have to add into the dashboard ?,"Start with India and Middle East, followed by Japan
Framework should be built in flexible manner to accomadate all markets."
3,In what format the data will stored for existing countries ?,"Once access to GCP is granted, data for all markets can be accessed from it."
4,We assume all the data stored in AWS ?,Yes.  Also available on GCP
5,"Is there any data cleanse activity required. If yes,can you please confirm how much extent we have to do the cleanup",Data is accurate and no cleansing is expected.
6,How is the data quality for other countries ,"Data (Sellout for retail/ecommerce, Shipment for wholesale) is accurate and used in our regular business reporting."
7,"The data is in same format as existing China data is ? In terms of  (Dimensions, Granularity)","Transaction data - Yes.
Master data (store, product) would have few localized attributes (e.g. bricks for India).  
Dimensions should be common to promote roll-up of numbers.
Computation logic for metrics is same for all markets."
8,Is there a need for data transformation ? How many ETL jobs are running currently ?,"Not required as data is already transformed. 
Need to factor in structure to handle hierarchies (store, product) in reports/dashboards to allow drill-down/drill-across capabilities."
9,Do we need to create the data model for this exercise ?,Not a priority.
10,what is the current process of creating dasboard ? Is there data warehouse/database in place . Please elaborate,"Dashboards are created in tableau and published on company's tableau portal.
Links to data source (HANA) is built into the portal.  If new connection links are required that can be created.
Said that, how the dashboard would work with cloud is to be checked."
11,What is the size of total data which we have to brint into the dashboard,Will get it from platform team.
